Help users find your video content and increase your revenue from videos. 

== Description ==

Help users find your video content and increase your revenue. We worked with Raptive to build a solution to increase the discoverability and SEO value of your recipe videos.

Cultivate Video Pages creates an archive of all your videos, which links to individual video pages. These video pages feature a large video player at the top of the page, a short description of the recipe, and a link to the full post.

If you are a Raptive publisher, they can automatically import all of your existing recipe videos into Cultivate Video Pages.
